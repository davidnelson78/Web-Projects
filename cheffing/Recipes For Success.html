          <strong>Q: What&rsquo;s the difference between various kinds of salts?</strong>
		  <p><strong>A: </strong>The most commonly used salt is plain old table salt, which is highly ground and refined to remove impurities and trace minerals. The problem with heavily ground salt is that it can clump together.</p>
		  <p>Sea salt is made by evaporating seawater. Depending on where it&rsquo;s harvested and how it was processed, it usually contains trace minerals like potassium, iron, and zinc. Sea salt is often less ground than regular refined salt, so if you sprinkle it on top of your food after it&rsquo;s been cooked, it may have a different feel in the mouth and cause a more potent &ldquo;flavor burst&rdquo; than refined salt. The trace minerals and impurities found in sea salt can also affect the taste, but this varies greatly between different brands.</p>
		  <p>The main difference between regular salt and kosher salt is the structure of the flakes. We find that kosher salt, due to its large fl ake size, is easier to spread over food. Kosher salt will have a different texture and fl avor burst, but if you allow the salt to dissolve in the food, there really isn&rsquo;t any difference compared to regular table salt.</p>

          <strong>Q: What&rsquo;s the best way to prepare steaks on the grill?</strong>
          <p><strong>A:</strong> First, I always look for USDA Prime beef, because it has such rich marbling &mdash; and, as we all know, marbling means fat and fat means flavor. Brushing your steaks with clarified butter adds great flavor and juiciness, and will help prevent the steaks from sticking to the grill. After the butter, liberally season your steaks with kosher salt and pepper on both sides. Make sure your grill is seriously hot. High heat will really sear the outside of your steaks, leaving you with that fantastic char on the outside along with a nice, juicy interior.</p>
			<p>Don&rsquo;t overcook! Press down on the steaks with your finger. A little bit of &ldquo;bounce&rdquo; means they&rsquo;re medium rare, which is when you want to pull the steaks off the grill. Remember, they&rsquo;re going to continue cooking after you take them off the heat, so be diligent about this step. Be patient. Allow your steaks to rest for 10 minutes before diving in. This gives the meat time to relax so the juices can redistribute. Trust me, you&rsquo;ll be rewarded for your patience.</p>

          <strong>Q: How do I utilize everything from the garden, root to stem?</strong>
          <p><strong>A:</strong> As chefs, we want to make sure that we don&rsquo;t waste anything from the garden, and we try to be creative in utilizing of products in the garden. One important ingredient in a useful garden is to plant lots of herbs. You can utilize herbs in so many ways, from homemade vinaigrettes to marinades to using the whole leaves in salads. It&rsquo;s also great to put together chive flowers, mint, oregano, and thyme to create an herb centerpiece for the buffet table.</p>
          <p>Lavender also has many uses, from teas to vodka infusion, honey, and ice cream. Lavender flowers look great on a cheese plate as a beautiful garnish, and are equally great in a lavender Moscow mule. Did you know the stems of beets can be tempura-fried for an earthly delicious treat? Or that squash blossoms can be stuffed with herbed cheese and tempura- fried to yield another meal from one product? </p>

          <strong>Q1: Why choose sustainable seafood?</strong>
		  <p><strong>A:</strong> Making the decision to purchase only sustainable seafood is extremely helpful to the environment and something I hope you consider. Seafood that is sustainable has many identifying factors, including: tracking the population of the species, the carbon footprint left by industrial fishing, the effects fishing has on all sea life in the natural ecosystem, and the quality of work life for the fisherman.</p>
	      <p>There are two best practices to assist you in understanding about the fish you&rsquo;re buying. The first is to know the person you&rsquo;re buying from &mdash; talk to them and ask questions. Find out where they&rsquo;re sourcing the fish from, and ask if they can tell you with certainty that the fish is sustainable.</p>
		  <p>The second thing I recommend is to download the Seafood Watch app for your iPhone. Seafood Watch is a program located at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. They have a user-friendly app that helps identify sustainable fish using a green light for best choices, yellow light for good alternatives, and red light for fish to avoid.</p>

                  <p><strong>For the Honey-Roasted Pecans: </strong>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Melt butter in a bowl then add honey and pecans. Toss to coat then spread out on a silpat or parchment paper-lined baking sheet and bake for 5-6 minutes, or until golden brown and fragrant (watch carefully so they don't burn.) Sprinkle lightly with salt then set aside and let cool completely (can be made ahead of time.)</p>
                  <p><strong>For the Berry-Balsamic Vinaigrette: </strong>Add blackberries and sugar to a food processor or blender then process or blend until berries are crushed. Let sit for a minute then add remaining ingredients and process or blend until smooth. Set aside (can be made ahead of time.)
					Divide lettuce between plates then top with blackberries, blue cheese crumbles, and honey-roasted pecans. Dress with berry-balsamic vinaigrette then serve.</p>
