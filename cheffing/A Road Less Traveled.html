      <h1>Never <em>ever<em> become a chef: advice from a chef</h1>
      <p>I thought i&rsquo;d share some revelations, and insights. Ideally if this could reach anyone, its kids, teens, tweens and the like who aspire to be chefs, like I did many a year ago. This is a compilation of all the reasons you shouldn&rsquo;t be a chef:</p>

	    <h2>There is no such thing as sick</h2>
        <img src="images/measuring cups.jpg" alt="">
		<p>If you are not on life support, then you are fine. Cut your finger off? put a band-aid on&#8230;or better yet cauterise it on the stove both fast and effective. you have the flu? no you don&#8217;t it&#8217;s a cold, and even if it were the flu &#8211; put a mask on and get your ass to work. In my career, closely drawing a two decades now, I&#8217;ve had two sick days: both times I was in hospital. If your feet can carry you, you can work&#8230;and you will work, nay not even from obligation, but from an odd combination of fear, guilt and compassion. Fear that your family will fail without you and fear that you will return having let them down.</p>

	    <h2>You will miss important life occasions</h2>
        <img src="images/knife.jpg" alt="knife">
		<p>Birthdays; Public Holidays; Occasional Weddings; Parties; Christenings; <strong>Weekends.</strong></p>
		<p>Its unrealistic in this industry to assume that you&#8217;ll ever have these off. The rest of the world plays whilst you toil, weekends are almost a taboo &#8211; and this will generally eliminate most parties and birthdays as the rest of the world will want to do this on <em><strong>Their</strong></em><strong> </strong>weekends. it is possibly the biggest killer of potential chef careers. It can be a very lonesome and frustrating life to those who aren&#8217;t willing to make the sacrifice. Regularly I will forgo a friend&#8217;s birthday even though I had booked the time off 4 months prior to that occasion (to whom I still have to apologise to regularly) In most industries you can &#8220;pick up the workload&#8221; on another day if you are unable to work. a kitchen however is more delicate. they have <em><strong>exactly the right amount of staff</strong></em><strong> </strong>one person missing can halt the entire functionality of a restaurant. which brings me to my next point.</p>

        <h2>Relationships will be difficult</h2>
        <img src="images/peppermill.jpg" alt="">
		<p>Another common misconception when someone goes into a relationship with a chef is that we will cook for you constantly. Though we are passionate about food, generally we will be working when you want to be fed. I&#8217;m one of the only chefs in my circle of peers who still cooks &#8220;properly&#8221; at home on a regular basis; most survive on a diet composed of instant meals, take out and dregs of half eaten chip packets. Time however is probably the biggest killer of relationships in our industry. It is difficult for most (not all, there&#8217;s still hope kiddies) to be with someone who is consistently never there, someone who (it seems) is more dedicated to his or her profession than the potential love of his/her life. Time will always be an instigator of hardships when it comes to chefs. which progresses to the next point:</p>

        <h2>Your hours are f@%?#d</h2>
		<img src="images/spatula.jpg" alt="">
		<p>though many people will regularly complain about an 8 hour day (inclusive of 2 to 3 breaks) or even god forbid a 10 hour day, you will savor the rare occasion you get an 8 hour shift with no break whatsoever. The average shift for a chef is around the 12 hour mark (according to a recent census) though I personally and quite regularly work more. You will stand on your feet all day, sweat, and toil. Your entire working career will be an endurance marathon for both your body and mind. cuts, burrs, burns they are all part of the process.</p>

	  	<h2>alcoholism and drug abuse will be very high</h2>
		<img src="images/mortar & pestle.jpg" alt="">
		<p>It&#8217;s no secret that this industry is rife with illicit substances and drunks. We are already sourced from the fringes of society, people who often fit in nowhere else. Some use recreational drugs, some use hard drugs and are completely addicted. Often you will find a waitress or chef racking up lines on a pizza tray at the end of the day before heading out to a night club, looking for escapism. Addiction is high (pardon the pun) among all people in our industry, and your ability to cope, stay away from, or fall into it &#8211; is completely up to the individual. You will see some of the highlights of human injustice, and bear witness  to (and possibly be a part of) a plethora, and cocktail of drug (ranging from weed to smack) and alcohol abuse.</p>

	    <h2>You&#8217;re a piece of @%?#!</h2>
		<img src="images/whisk.jpg" alt="">
		<p>or at least the majority of your superiors will inform you of this. Where as in the real world verbal bullying is now room for a class action lawsuit, in our domain it is second nature. Also unlike the majority of things in this modern-day and age you are never &#8220;given&#8221; anything in this industry &#8211; because contrary to the ribbon you get for participating in a school running carnival (coming 4th last) you, like everyone else, start at the very bottom.  you must earn it, you must climb the hierarchy slowly and arduously. No rewards are given for &#8220;trying&#8221;  either you do your job, or you don&#8217;t.. and get fired -simple. Peeling 100 lbs of potatoes, picking 1 gal. of individual thyme leaves (don&#8217;t you dare cheat and just strip the stalks, I will throw that shit back in your face) these are all jobs that will challenge your very essence to overcome the sheer boredom, inanity and pain of it, as all of the chefs before you have done. But this is the process, you will start learning, you will always be learning.</p>

        <p>But perhaps you are someone like myself, who even after reading this says &#8220;who cares&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8217;m better&#8221; or even &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be the best chef who has ever lived&#8221; then congratulations, you have the only tool that you&#8217;ll ever need to surpass any adversity, to conquer any fear, any challenge and emerge victorious. You have something that people in this day and age lack, something our 13-year-old kitchen hand will one day hopefully learn, something that has driven me to a succesful career. That driving force is passion, passion is not listening to those who doubt you and doing what you&#8217;re heart desires, ignoring the nay sayers and becoming what you are capable of. If you so choose to immerse yourself with confidence and dedication, your ends are limitless. If in any profession you are lucky enough to not only be enamoured and passionate about what you do, but also earn a living from it, then nothing will stop you. If per chance this does fall into the hands of a young mind wanting to be moulded I urge you take this wisdom.</p>
		<p><b><i>Be relentless in your willingness to learn</i></b></p>
		<p><em><strong>Never steal, and try not to lie</strong></em></p>
		<p><b><i>Be resilient to all adversity; It&#8217;s one of the greatest weapons you can use (and there will be many more problems than I have listed here)</i></b></p>
		<p><b><i>You&#8217;re never too good, you&#8217;re never too old and you&#8217;re never too unintelligent to achieve if you so desire</i></b></p>      </article>
