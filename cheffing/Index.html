          <h2>What's Cooking...</h2>
          <p>The world of professional cooking gets more public attention now than ever before thanks to celebrity chefs like Anthony Bourdain revealing the cutthroat competition and high-stakes rivalries behind the scenes in the culinary world; However this might not be a fair portrayal of the typical experience which is why I wanted to share a few of my own stories. </p>

          <p>Every chef will tell you that it&rsquo;s not only what he or she cooks, but how it&rsquo;s cooked that makes all the difference. They know that the reason we eat out isn&rsquo;t only to be social, but to experience food that just can&rsquo;t be made at home. That&rsquo;s why many chefs look to methods and ingredients that are difficult to replicate at home. Whether it&rsquo;s a grill that heats at a higher temperature than what&rsquo;s available at home, or a type of salt that isn&rsquo;t easy to find on a local grocery shelf, chefs have a way of making you wonder, &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I make it like that at home?&rdquo;</p>

          <p>If you love to cook so much that you want to make it your profession, consider becoming a chef. The path isn't easy - it involves long hours, physical labor, and heavy competition - but the reward is the opportunity to design creative dishes, run a kitchen, or even manage a restaurant.</p>

          <img src="images/bonus material.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="bonus material">
          <p>For me a restaurant kitchen is full of life and fun. When I walk into a kitchen I see smiles, passion, and some of the most creative and kind people I have ever known. That light that I tend to see when I walk into the kitchen is not always there for those working in the kitchen. The restaurant industry is not an easy one. Chefs work long hours, addiction runs rampant, greedy, jealous, and parasitic people flock to the brightness of those behind the counter, the pay is never what it should be, and the hard work never stops no matter how big you get. The life of a Chef is not easy and anyone who says different has never worked in a restaurant.</p>
